# Getting Started with Redux Toolkit

The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

- "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
- "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
- "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

## Installation

```md
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```

```md
npm install react-redux
```

## Step

1. Create Slice
2. Create Store
3. Configure React-Redix into index.js
4. Use in "Functional" & "Class" Component
